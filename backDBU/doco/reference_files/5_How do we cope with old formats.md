### How do we cope with old formats?

The way to identify old and new formats is using the "unique cells". You need to find cells unique to the new and old, and use those.

It is essential to ensure the unique identification works both ways, so old files are not identified as new, not new as old. This is easily done by using multiple cells in the Uniqe Cells Address, eg A11,A22.
