PSMS is the AusPayNet system for handling data files from members and other participating organisations.
These files include:
* monthly data files (mainly from members)
* quarterly files
* yearly files
* statistical files

All these data files are checked for correct format, and verified against previous data. There are limits on expected variation from month to month and year to year. If a data point exceeds this, the data is rejected, and may only be accepted with an associated comment.
