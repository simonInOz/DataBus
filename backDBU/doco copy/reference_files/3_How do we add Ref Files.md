### How do we add Reference Files?

Once a reference file is correctly edited with its config sheet, you should upload it to the system. Logged in as admin, go to Admin, **Upload Reference Files**

Then you need to drop in the reference file(s) and click *Upload Files* â€“ it should upload and appear on the list of current Reference Files

----

On the same page you can download all Reference Files as a zip. 

**NB The files downloaded are exactly the files uploaded - they do not reflect any changes made to the datebase entry for that reference file. The config sheet is not changed**
